# Intent-Recognition

Intent recognition based on speech signal processing. 

This study was based on the KISMET Data base where humans were interacting with the Kismet robot where they were expressing exagerated emotions such as approbaton and prohibition.

The recognition was done in two parts: using the whole signals, and using the voiced part of the signals only.
